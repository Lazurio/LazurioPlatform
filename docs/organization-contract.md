# Organization contract authority and convergence

The maintained Lazurio Core contract is authoritative, not a new Platform schema:

- [Manifest family](https://github.com/HumanAndMachines/Lazurio/blob/b6c2849e2f5b1b6ca91cf197a597be7dc9270ceb/manual/lazurio-manifest-family.md), accepted by decisions 0026, 0031 and 0042.
- [Authored schema](https://github.com/HumanAndMachines/Lazurio/blob/b6c2849e2f5b1b6ca91cf197a597be7dc9270ceb/lazurio/lazurio.organization.v1.schema.json), SHA256 `e75588a6fef1d96953f1241fea377bdfd89d07c007d6d539da1b4cf12a9b1f61`.

Platform must consume this same versioned contract. The current independently
authored `canonical-manifest.ts` parser is not an exact vendored schema or a complete
Core resolver. Before real Organization adoption, pin the upstream schema with
provenance and its applicable license/notices and verify conformance. Do not copy
legacy source under Platform's license or create another schema authority.

## Current correspondence and gaps

`organization.forge_binding`, optional `root_repository`, metadata, inventory pointer,
extensions and compatibility projection fields are upstream wire fields. They are
not invented Platform fields. Verified Organization/repository IDs remain a complete
pair; owner and binding state must match and the compatibility branch remains `main`.
The root repository name is explicit, not derived as `<Owner>/<Owner>_GEN3`.
Shape validation is neither live provider verification nor permission to operate.

Templates remain valid authored declarations for inspection/conversion preview, but
`kind: template` excludes the root from runtime. Shared application discovery returns
`template-not-runtime` before reading descendants; executable selection refuses it.
CLI and Launchpad use that same boundary. A filename or declared app cannot turn a
template into an actionable Organization.

Upstream resolves legacy, transition, projection drift, conflict, current and missing
states through one Core owner. Its normalized resource and resolution envelope are
not the authored schema. Platform's canonical-only application reader and pure
conversion preview do **not** implement that resolver, migration or finalization gate.
Do not interpret their success as permission to operate on an unqualified transition
or to remove `company.gen3.json`.

The upstream contract already makes `lazurio.organization.json` canonical during a
parity-valid transition, with the legacy file a generated projection, not a second
authority. Removal waits for the separate reader/update/finalization gate and an
authorized per-Organization change. A later decision to finish the rollout does not
waive those existing gates. Real Organization materialization remains blocked on
consumer convergence and its owning rollout, not on inventing another filename or
schema. No real conversion, cloning or legacy removal occurs in this increment.
